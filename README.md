This is my attempt to formalize "Grundlagen der Analysis" by Edmond Landau in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

My first encounter with this book was while reading "Calculus" by Tom Apostol, in which its mentioned as a resource with the details of operations and proof of theorems which in that book are directly taken as properties or axioms.

As I have a strong insterest in proovers, in particular Coq and Lean, I though this could be a nice challenging project.
