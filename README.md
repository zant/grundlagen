This is my attempt to formalize "Grundlagen der Analysis" by Edmond Landau in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

My first encounter with this book was while reading "Calculus" by Tom Apostol, in which is mentioned as a resource with the details of the construction of foundational operations and proofs of theorems which in most books are directly taken as properties or axioms.

As I'm currently learning Coq, I thought this could be a fun project to work on.
